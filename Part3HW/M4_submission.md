Evidence should show a larger number of clients than the target list of the private message to show it works.

I then used an if and an else<br>if statement that set a variable named values to tails if coin was<br>equal to 0 and set it to heads if the coin was equal<br>to 1.

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> What feature did you pick? Briefly explain how you implemented it</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The feature I implemented was the:<div><ul><li>Dice roller given a command and text format<br>of &quot;roll #d#&quot; (i.e., roll 2d6)</li><ol><li>Command should be in the format of roll<br>#d# (i.e., roll 1d10)</li><li>The result should mention&nbsp;<i>who</i>&nbsp;did&nbsp;<i>what</i>&nbsp;and got what&nbsp;<i>result</i>&nbsp;(i.e., Bob rolled 1d10 and<br>got 7)</li></ol></ul><div><div>For this implementation I used a else if block that would check<br>if the words being input start with roll. If they did it would<br>be passed to a try block that would split the command at the<br>space after roll. Then it would split the #d# at the character d.<br>This would give us an array of two values. The first value was<br>set equal to diceCount whereas the second value was set equal to diceSides.<br>Next a variable named diceTotal would be declared which would then be used<br>in a for loop that would use the math.random operator&nbsp; to give a<br>value based on the diceSides variable. This value was then added to diceTotal<br>and the for loop would add 1 to i to go through the<br>loop once more. A broadcast would then send each client who did what<br>and got what result.</div></div></div><br></p><br></td></tr>
